# ZigStickies
An OS X application that is a customized imitation of Apple's Stickies app. Primary use is as a TODO list and to temporarily hold copy/pasted code.

The goals of this app are:

- Use as TODO list
- Fast way to strikethrough (cmd+S) and un-strikethrough (cmd+shift+S) items
- Monospaced font for copy/pasting code
- Have random, non-annoying colors for stickies
